# FoodSharing

Project Overview:

The food sharing website is a comprehensive online platform designed to alleviate hunger and reduce food wastage in the community. It functions as a bridge between individuals who have excess food and those who are in need of it. The platform offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily post details about available food items, such as type, quantity, and location.

Problems Faced:

1.Food Wastage: Many households and businesses often have excess food that goes to waste.

2.Food Insecurity: Some individuals and families struggle to access an adequate and nutritious diet.

3.Logistical Challenges: Coordinating the collection and delivery of excess food can be difficult and time-consuming.


Solution:

1.Efficient Food Redistribution: The platform efficiently matches excess food with those in need, reducing food wastage and ensuring that surplus food reaches those who can benefit from it.

2.Community Engagement: By involving the community in the process of sharing food, the platform creates a sense of solidarity and shared responsibility.

3.Convenience: The online platform makes it convenient for users to participate in food sharing, as they can easily post, browse, and volunteer from their homes.


How It Solves the Problem:

1.Reduces Food Wastage: By facilitating the redistribution of excess food, the platform helps reduce food wastage at the community level.

2.Addresses Food Insecurity: Individuals and families in need can access nutritious food through the platform, improving their food security and overall well-being.

3.Promotes Sustainability: The project promotes sustainable practices by encouraging the reuse of excess food rather than its disposal.

4.Builds Community Resilience: By fostering a sense of community and mutual support, the platform strengthens community resilience and cohesion.

5.In conclusion, the food sharing website is a holistic solution to address hunger and food wastage by leveraging technology to connect surplus food with those in need, fostering community engagement, and promoting sustainable practices.



How to run the project:


1.Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code: Launch Visual Studio Code and open the folder where you have saved all your project files.

2.Install Node.js: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Node.js. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

3.Install project dependencies: Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (Terminal > New Terminal) and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
npm install

4.Start the server: Run the following command in the terminal to start the server:
node server.js

5.This command will start your backend server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running.

6.Access the website: Open a web browser and go to the URL where your server is hosted. If you are running the server locally, the URL will typically be http://localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port number specified in your server.js file.
